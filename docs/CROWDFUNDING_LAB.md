# Crowdfunding Lab: Fundraising Campaign

| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | 45-60 minutes |
| **Difficulty** | Intermediate |
| **Prerequisites** | Wallet created, test ETH obtained |
| **Roles** | Campaign Creator (deployer), Contributors (students) |

A hands-on lab where students create and participate in a crowdfunding campaign. Learn about collective funding, goal-based triggers, and automatic refunds when goals aren't met.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, students will:

1. **Understand goal-based contracts** - Actions triggered when conditions are met
2. **Experience collective action** - Many small contributions reaching a goal
3. **Learn about refund mechanisms** - What happens when fundraising fails
4. **Work with time constraints** - Deadlines affect contract behavior
5. **See escrow patterns** - Funds held until conditions are satisfied

---

## The Scenario

A project creator launches a crowdfunding campaign with a funding goal and deadline. Contributors send ETH to support the project. If the goal is reached, the creator can withdraw funds. If not, contributors can claim refunds.

```

---

## Roles

| Role | Who | Responsibilities |
|------|-----|------------------|
| **Creator** | Instructor or designated student | Deploy campaign, withdraw if successful |
| **Contributors** | Students | Contribute ETH, claim refunds if failed |

---

## Part A: Creator Setup

> **Docker users:** Run these commands inside the container after `docker-compose exec ethereum-trainer bash`. Use `cd /app/scripts/cli-labs/standalone` instead of `cd scripts/cli-labs/standalone`.

### Step 1: Deploy the Crowdfunding Contract

**Using CLI Contract Builder:**
```bash
cd /app/scripts/cli-labs/standalone   # or scripts/cli-labs/standalone for local dev
node interactive.js
```

1. Select **7. Contract Builder Lab**
2. Select **5. Crowdfunding Campaign**
3. Configure your campaign:
   - Campaign name: "Community Garden Project"
   - Goal: 50 ETH
   - Duration: 7 days (use 1 day for classroom demo)
   - Minimum contribution: 0.01 ETH
4. Deploy the contract
5. **Save the contract address**

**Or Using Hardhat Console:**
```javascript
let Crowdfunding = await ethers.getContractFactory("contracts/student/Crowdfunding_123456.sol:Crowdfunding");

// Deploy (creator = deployer)
let campaign = await Crowdfunding.deploy(
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
);
await campaign.waitForDeployment();

let address = await campaign.getAddress();
console.log("Campaign Contract:", address);

// Verify setup
let status = await campaign.getCampaignStatus();
console.log("Campaign:", status[0]);
console.log("Goal:", ethers.formatEther(status[1]), "ETH");
console.log("Raised:", ethers.formatEther(status[2]), "ETH");
console.log("Deadline:", new Date(Number(status[3]) * 1000));
```

### Step 2: Share with Class

```

### Step 3: Add to Dashboard

1. Open `/dashboard.html`
2. Select **Crowdfunding** contract type
3. Paste contract address
4. Click **Add Contract**

The dashboard shows a progress bar filling as contributions come in!

---

## Part B: Contributing (Students)

### Method 1: CLI Playground

```bash
cd scripts/cli-labs/standalone
npm start
```

1. Select **5. Switch account** and import your private key
2. Select **8. Playground (JS console)**

```javascript
// Connect to campaign
ctx.abi = [
  'function contribute() external payable',
  'function getCampaignStatus() view returns (string, uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256, bool, bool)',
  'function getProgress() view returns (uint256)',
  'function contributions(address) view returns (uint256)',
  'function minimumContribution() view returns (uint256)'
]
ctx.campaign = new ethers.Contract('CONTRACT_ADDRESS', ctx.abi, wallet)

// Check campaign status
let status = await ctx.campaign.getCampaignStatus()
console.log('Campaign:', status[0])
console.log('Goal:', ethers.formatEther(status[1]), 'ETH')
console.log('Raised:', ethers.formatEther(status[2]), 'ETH')
console.log('Progress:', (await ctx.campaign.getProgress()).toString() + '%')

// Make a contribution
let myContribution = ethers.parseEther('0.5')  // 0.5 ETH
await ctx.campaign.contribute({ value: myContribution })
console.log('Contributed 0.5 ETH!')

// Check your total contribution
let total = await ctx.campaign.contributions(wallet.address)
console.log('My total contribution:', ethers.formatEther(total), 'ETH')
```

### Method 2: Direct ETH Transfer

The contract accepts direct ETH transfers:
```javascript
// Simply send ETH to the contract address
await wallet.sendTransaction({
  to: 'CONTRACT_ADDRESS',
  value: ethers.parseEther('1.0')
})
console.log('Contributed 1 ETH!')
```

### Method 3: Multiple Contributions

You can contribute multiple times (total is tracked):
```javascript
// First contribution
await ctx.campaign.contribute({ value: ethers.parseEther('0.5') })

// Second contribution (both are tracked)
await ctx.campaign.contribute({ value: ethers.parseEther('0.3') })

// Check total
let myTotal = await ctx.campaign.contributions(wallet.address)
console.log('Total contributed:', ethers.formatEther(myTotal), 'ETH')
```

---

## Part C: Monitoring Progress (Everyone)

### Check Campaign Status

```javascript
let status = await campaign.getCampaignStatus()

console.log('\n=== CAMPAIGN STATUS ===')
console.log('Name:', status[0])
console.log('Goal:', ethers.formatEther(status[1]), 'ETH')
console.log('Raised:', ethers.formatEther(status[2]), 'ETH')
console.log('Contributors:', status[4].toString())
console.log('Goal Reached:', status[5])
console.log('Funds Withdrawn:', status[6])
```

### Visual Progress Bar

```javascript
let progress = await campaign.getProgress()
let pct = Number(progress)
let filled = Math.floor(pct / 5)
let empty = 20 - filled
let bar = '█'.repeat(filled) + '░'.repeat(empty)

console.log(`Progress: [${bar}] ${pct}%`)
```

### Time Remaining

```javascript
let remaining = await campaign.getTimeRemaining()
let hours = Number(remaining) / 3600

if (hours > 0) {
  console.log(`Time remaining: ${hours.toFixed(1)} hours`)
} else {
  console.log('Campaign deadline has passed')
}
```

---

## Part D: Success Path - Goal Reached

When the campaign reaches its goal:

### What Happens Automatically
- `goalReached` becomes `true`
- Contributors cannot claim refunds
- Creator can withdraw funds

### Creator Withdraws Funds

```javascript
// Check goal status first
let status = await campaign.getCampaignStatus()
console.log('Goal reached:', status[5])

if (status[5]) {
  // Withdraw all funds
  ctx.withdrawAbi = ['function withdrawFunds() external']
  ctx.campaignCreator = new ethers.Contract('CONTRACT_ADDRESS', ctx.withdrawAbi, wallet)
  
  await ctx.campaignCreator.withdrawFunds()
  console.log('Funds withdrawn to creator!')
}
```

---

## Part E: Failure Path - Goal Not Reached

If the deadline passes without reaching the goal:

### What Happens
- Contributors can claim refunds
- Creator cannot withdraw
- Each contributor gets back their exact contribution

### Claim Refund

```javascript
// Check if eligible for refund
let status = await campaign.getCampaignStatus()
let timeLeft = await campaign.getTimeRemaining()

if (!status[5] && Number(timeLeft) < 0) {
  // Goal not reached and deadline passed - refund available
  
  ctx.refundAbi = ['function claimRefund() external', 'function contributions(address) view returns (uint256)']
  ctx.campaignRefund = new ethers.Contract('CONTRACT_ADDRESS', ctx.refundAbi, wallet)
  
  // Check refund amount
  let refundAmount = await ctx.campaignRefund.contributions(wallet.address)
  console.log('Refund available:', ethers.formatEther(refundAmount), 'ETH')
  
  // Claim refund
  await ctx.campaignRefund.claimRefund()
  console.log('Refund claimed!')
}
```

---

## Part F: Creator Management

### Extend Deadline

If more time is needed (before goal reached):
```javascript
ctx.extendAbi = ['function extendDeadline(uint256 additionalDays) external']
ctx.campaignExtend = new ethers.Contract('CONTRACT_ADDRESS', ctx.extendAbi, wallet)

// Add 3 more days
await ctx.campaignExtend.extendDeadline(3)
console.log('Deadline extended by 3 days')
```

### Change Beneficiary

Transfer creator rights to another address:
```javascript
ctx.adminAbi = ['function setCreator(address) external']
ctx.campaignAdmin = new ethers.Contract('CONTRACT_ADDRESS', ctx.adminAbi, wallet)

await ctx.campaignAdmin.setCreator('NEW_CREATOR_ADDRESS')
console.log('Creator changed')
```

## Quick Reference

### Contract Functions

| Function | Who Can Call | What it Does |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| `contribute()` | Anyone | Add funds to campaign (payable) |
| `claimRefund()` | Contributors | Get refund if goal not reached after deadline |
| `withdrawFunds()` | Creator only | Withdraw funds if goal reached |
| `extendDeadline(days)` | Creator only | Add more time (before goal reached) |
| `setCreator(addr)` | Admin only | Change beneficiary |
| `getCampaignStatus()` | Anyone | Get full campaign info |
| `getProgress()` | Anyone | Get percentage funded |
| `getTimeRemaining()` | Anyone | Seconds until deadline |
| `contributions(addr)` | Anyone | Get contributor's total |

### Campaign States

| State | Goal Reached | Deadline Passed | Available Actions |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Active | No | No | Contribute, extend deadline |
| Goal Met | Yes | Any | Creator withdraws |
| Failed | No | Yes | Contributors claim refunds |
| Completed | Yes | Yes | Funds withdrawn |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Below minimum contribution"
Your contribution is too small:
```javascript
let min = await campaign.minimumContribution();
console.log("Minimum:", ethers.formatEther(min), "ETH");
```

### "Campaign has ended"
The deadline has passed. Check status:
```javascript
let time = await campaign.getTimeRemaining();
console.log("Time remaining:", Number(time), "seconds");
```

### "Goal not reached"
You're trying to withdraw but the goal wasn't met:
```javascript
let status = await campaign.getCampaignStatus();
console.log("Goal reached:", status[5]);
console.log("Raised:", ethers.formatEther(status[2]), "of", ethers.formatEther(status[1]));
```

### "Campaign still active"
You're trying to refund but the campaign hasn't ended:
```javascript
let time = await campaign.getTimeRemaining();
if (time > 0) {
  console.log("Wait", Number(time) / 3600, "more hours");
}
```

### "Goal was reached - no refunds"
The campaign succeeded! Contributors don't get refunds on successful campaigns.

### "Already withdrawn"
Funds have already been withdrawn. Check:
```javascript
let status = await campaign.getCampaignStatus();
console.log("Withdrawn:", status[6]);
```

## Discussion Questions

1. **Why are refunds only available after the deadline AND goal not met?**
   - Prevents manipulation (contribute then immediately refund)
   - Mirrors real crowdfunding (commitment until outcome is known)

2. **What prevents the creator from withdrawing early?**
   - Contract requires `goalReached == true`
   - Code enforces the rule, not trust

3. **Why track individual contributions instead of just total?**
   - Enables accurate refunds per contributor
   - Provides transparency on who funded what

4. **How does this compare to Kickstarter?**
   - Similar "all-or-nothing" model
   - But no middleman taking fees
   - Automatic execution of rules

5. **What if someone contributes after the goal is met?**
   - Additional funds go to the creator too
   - Could modify contract to stop accepting once goal met

---

## Extension Challenges

### 1. Tiered Rewards
Track contribution tiers for different reward levels:
```javascript
// Manually check tier
let amount = await campaign.contributions(address);
if (amount >= ethers.parseEther("10")) {
  console.log("Gold tier contributor!");
} else if (amount >= ethers.parseEther("1")) {
  console.log("Silver tier contributor!");
} else {
  console.log("Bronze tier contributor!");
}
```

### 2. Milestone Funding
Deploy multiple campaigns for project phases.

### 3. Matching Funds
Create a second contributor that doubles all contributions up to a limit.

### 4. Contributor Voting
Let contributors vote on how funds are used.

## Complete Lab Timeline (30-40 minutes)

| Time | Activity | Who |
|------|----------|-----|
| 0-5 min | Deploy campaign, explain goal/deadline | Creator |
| 5-10 min | Fund student wallets | Instructor |
| 10-20 min | Students make contributions | Students |
| 20-25 min | Monitor progress on dashboard | Everyone |
| 25-30 min | Goal reached → withdrawal demo | Creator |
| 30-35 min | (Alt) Goal not reached → refund demo | Students |
| 35-40 min | Discussion and Q&A | Everyone |

### Classroom Tips

- **For quick demos**: Set a low goal (5-10 ETH) and short duration
- **For engagement**: Have students compete to see who can push it over the goal
- **For drama**: Set goal slightly higher than expected contributions to show refund path
