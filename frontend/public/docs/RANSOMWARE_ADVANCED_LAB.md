# Ransomware Investigation Lab (Multi-Victim)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | 90-120 minutes |
| **Difficulty** | Intermediate |
| **Prerequisites** | Completed basic Ransomware Investigation Lab, Hardhat console access |
| **Roles** | Investigator (student) |

An interactive forensics lab where students trace a coordinated multi-victim ransomware attack through a complex tumbler network. This lab involves more steps than the basic lab but uses the same investigation techniques.

---

## Overview

This lab builds on the basic ransomware investigation by adding:
- **3 different victims** paying ransoms simultaneously
- **Multiple attacker wallets** (one per victim)
- **4 Layer 1 tumblers** with fund splitting
- **2 Layer 2 convergence points**
- **A single consolidator** where all trails merge
- **Final cash-out wallet**

---

## Learning Objectives

1. **Multi-source tracing** - Follow 3 parallel money trails
2. **Pattern recognition** - Identify splitting and convergence patterns
3. **Correlation analysis** - Link separate attacks to one criminal organization
4. **Complex network navigation** - Trace through multi-layer tumbler chains
5. **Asset recovery estimation** - Calculate recoverable funds

---

## The Scenario

A ransomware gang targeted three companies in a coordinated attack:

| Victim | Company | Ransom Amount |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| A | TechStart Inc | 3 ETH |
| B | MedData Corp | 4 ETH |
| C | RetailPlus LLC | 2.5 ETH |
| **Total** | | **9.5 ETH** |

Each victim paid to a different attacker wallet, but the funds eventually converge at a single cash-out point.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Blockchain running**: `npm run chain` (or Docker container running)
2. **Advanced scenario generated**: `node forensics-setup-advanced.js`
3. **Two terminals**: One for the lab, one for Hardhat console

---

## Docker Setup

If running via Docker, follow these instructions instead of the local setup.

### Starting the Container (Instructor)

```bash
# From the project root
docker-compose up --build
```

### Opening Multiple Shells

For this lab, you need **two shells** inside the container. Open **two separate terminal windows** on your host machine:

**Terminal Window 1:**
```bash
docker-compose exec ethereum-trainer bash
```

**Terminal Window 2:**
```bash
docker-compose exec ethereum-trainer bash
```

### Running the Lab in Docker

**Terminal 1** - Run the guided lab:
```bash
cd /app/scripts/cli-labs/standalone
node forensics-setup-advanced.js   # Generate scenario first
node 7-ransomware-advanced.js
```

**Terminal 2** - Open Hardhat console for investigation:
```bash
npx hardhat console --network localhost
```

### Important Docker Notes

- The blockchain starts fresh each time you rebuild the container
- Run `forensics-setup-advanced.js` after starting Docker to generate the scenario
- Victim addresses from previous sessions won't exist - use addresses from the new scenario
- All paths inside Docker are under `/app/`

---

## Setup (Instructor)

### Step 1: Start Blockchain

```bash
npm run chain
```

### Step 2: Generate Advanced Scenario

```bash
cd scripts/cli-labs/standalone
node forensics-setup-advanced.js
```

This creates:
- `.forensics-scenario-advanced.json` - Answer key (keep private)
- `forensics-case-advanced.json` - Student starting point with all 3 victim addresses

### Step 3: Share Case Information

Students receive:
- All 3 victim addresses
- Total reported amount (9.5 ETH)
- Hint: "All payments converge at a single wallet"

---

## Student Instructions

### Terminal 1: Run the Lab

```bash
cd scripts/cli-labs/standalone
node 7-ransomware-advanced.js
```

Or from the interactive menu: **Option 12**

### Terminal 2: Hardhat Console

```bash
npx hardhat console --network localhost
```

Use this to run investigation commands.

## Investigation Techniques

### Technique 1: Multi-Address Scanning

Scan multiple addresses in one loop:

```javascript
let addresses = [victim1, victim2, victim3]
let latest = await ethers.provider.getBlockNumber()

for (let addr of addresses) {
  console.log("Scanning:", addr)
  for (let i = 0; i <= latest; i++) {
    let block = await ethers.provider.getBlock(i, true)
    if (block.prefetchedTransactions) {
      block.prefetchedTransactions.forEach(tx => {
        if (tx.from.toLowerCase() === addr.toLowerCase()) {
          console.log("  To:", tx.to, "Value:", ethers.formatEther(tx.value))
        }
      })
    }
  }
}
```

### Technique 2: Find Convergence Points

Look for addresses that receive from multiple sources:

```javascript
let recipients = {}

for (let i = 0; i <= latest; i++) {
  let block = await ethers.provider.getBlock(i, true)
  if (block.prefetchedTransactions) {
    block.prefetchedTransactions.forEach(tx => {
      if (tx.to) {
        if (!recipients[tx.to]) recipients[tx.to] = []
        recipients[tx.to].push(tx.from)
      }
    })
  }
}

// Find addresses with multiple senders
for (let addr in recipients) {
  if (recipients[addr].length > 1) {
    console.log("Convergence point:", addr)
    console.log("  Receives from:", recipients[addr])
  }
}
```

### Technique 3: Check for Final Destination

```javascript
async function isFinal(address) {
  let hasOutgoing = false
  for (let i = 0; i <= latest; i++) {
    let block = await ethers.provider.getBlock(i, true)
    if (block.prefetchedTransactions) {
      for (let tx of block.prefetchedTransactions) {
        if (tx.from.toLowerCase() === address.toLowerCase()) {
          hasOutgoing = true
          break
        }
      }
    }
    if (hasOutgoing) break
  }
  
  let balance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(address)
  console.log("Has outgoing:", hasOutgoing)
  console.log("Balance:", ethers.formatEther(balance), "ETH")
  console.log("Is final destination:", !hasOutgoing && balance > 0n)
}
```

## Key Concepts

### Fund Splitting

Attacker 1 splits the ransom into two addresses:
- Makes tracing more complex
- Harder to correlate with original amount
- Requires following both paths

### Convergence

Multiple tumblers send to the same address:
- Reveals relationship between addresses
- Helps identify criminal organization
- Key indicator: same recipient from multiple Layer 1 addresses

### Consolidation

All trails merge at one point:
- Proves all attacks are connected
- Identifies the criminal organization's main wallet
- Critical for asset recovery

## Comparison: Basic vs Advanced Lab

| Aspect | Basic Lab | Advanced Lab |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Victims | 1 | 3 |
| Attacker wallets | 1 | 3 |
| Total addresses | 6 | 14 |
| Tumbler layers | 2 | 3 |
| Parallel paths | 1 (split) | 2 (converging) |
| Max score | 130 | 190 |
| Exercises | 6 | 9 |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Advanced case file not found"
Run the setup script:
```bash
node forensics-setup-advanced.js
```

### "Scenario data not found"
The `.forensics-scenario-advanced.json` file is missing. Re-run setup.

### Wrong victim order
The lab expects Victim A, B, C in order. Check your console output carefully.

### Can't find convergence
Look for addresses that appear as recipients from MULTIPLE sources. These are Layer 2 and consolidator addresses.

## Discussion Questions

1. **Why use different attacker wallets for each victim?**
   - Harder to initially correlate attacks
   - Each victim sees a unique address
   - Delays attribution

2. **What revealed this was a coordinated attack?**
   - All funds eventually converged
   - Same tumbler network used
   - Single final destination

3. **How would real investigators handle this scale?**
   - Automated tracing tools
   - Graph analysis software
   - Pattern recognition algorithms
   - Exchange cooperation for cash-out identification

4. **What could attackers do to make tracing harder?**
   - More tumbler layers
   - Time delays between hops
   - Mixing with unrelated transactions
   - Cross-chain transfers
   - Privacy coins

---

## Extension Challenges

1. **Reverse trace** - Start from final wallet, work backwards
2. **Fee analysis** - Calculate exact fees at each hop
3. **Timeline reconstruction** - Note block numbers, calculate timing
4. **Automated tracer** - Write a script that auto-traces from any victim
5. **Modify complexity** - Edit setup script to add more layers or victims
