# Instructor Lab Scenarios — Two 1-Hour Blocks

Three ready-to-use scenarios for keeping students busy across **two 1-hour lab blocks**. Each scenario uses the full lab stack: web interface, CLI labs, contract builder, forensics, and mini-labs.

**This document is written so students can follow it directly** — they will know where to go, what to do, and which lab guide to open for each activity.

## Block 1 (60 min)

### 0–5 min — Setup & Connection → LO-A1

**Instructor:**
- Start the lab: **Docker:** `docker-compose up --build` | **Windows:** `.\start-lab.ps1 -Mode instructor` | **Mac/Linux:** See Path Reference (manual or Docker).
- Write on the board:
  - **Contract Address** (e.g. `0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512`)
  - **RPC URL** (e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:8545` or your machine’s IP)
  - **Frontend URL** (e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:5173`)

**Students — Where to go:**
1. Open a browser and go to the **Frontend URL** from the board.
2. Click the **Live** tab. Scroll to the **Connection Setup** card.
3. Enter the **Contract Address** and **RPC URL** from the board. Click **Connect**.
4. Confirm you see "Connected to blockchain" (or similar). If not, use the **Diagnostics** view to troubleshoot.

---

### 5–15 min — Wallet & Faucet → LO-A2, LO-A3

**Students — What to do:**
1. On the main app, find the **Live** tab (or **Live Network**) in the top navigation.
2. In the **Account Manager** section:
   - Click **Create New Wallet** (or **Generate Wallet**).
   - **Save your private key** somewhere safe — you cannot recover it if lost.
   - Copy your **wallet address** (starts with `0x`).
3. Click **Request 5 ETH** (or **Get 5 ETH**) to receive test funds from the faucet.
4. Confirm your balance shows ~5 ETH.

**Lab document:** Main [README.md](../README.md) — “For Students” and “Running the Lab” sections.

**Instructor:** Use the instructor dashboard to fund any student who didn’t receive ETH. Dashboard: `http://<YOUR_IP>:5173/?mode=instructor`.

**Pause:** *“What is a private key? Why must you never share it?”*

---

### 15–25 min — First Transaction → LO-A4

**Students — What to do:**
1. Stay in the **Live** tab.
2. Find the **Send ETH** or **Transfer** section.
3. Enter a **recipient address** (another student’s address or one provided by the instructor).
4. Enter **1 ETH** as the amount.
5. Send the transaction and wait for confirmation.
6. Check your balance — it should decrease by 1 ETH plus a small gas fee.

**Pause:** *“What is gas? Why did you pay a small fee?”*

---

### 25–45 min — Proof-of-Stake Staking → LO-A5

**Students — What to do:**
1. In the **Live** tab, find the **Stake** or **Become Validator** section.
2. Stake **2 ETH** (minimum stake is typically 1 ETH).
3. Watch your **validator status** and **rewards** update.
4. Go to the **Learn** tab (top navigation).
5. Complete these mini-labs in the Learn section:
   - **Staking Rewards** — see how rewards accumulate
   - **Validator Probability** — understand selection odds
   - **Slashing Penalty** — see what happens if a validator misbehaves
6. If there is a **Chat** feature in the Live tab, send a short message.

**Instructor:** Advance epochs from the instructor dashboard so rewards update visibly.

**Pause:** *“Why would someone lock up ETH? What happens if a validator misbehaves?”*

---

### 45–60 min — Chat & Wrap-Up → LO-A5

**Students:** Send a message in the PoS chat if available.

**Instructor:** Briefly show the instructor dashboard (activity feed, network stats). Tell students: *“Next block we’ll do Token Concepts and a live classroom vote.”*

---

## Block 2 (60 min)

4. Use the **Fungible Token Visualizer** and **Non-Fungible Token Visualizer** (mini-labs in the same view).

**Note:** Sections 1–3 work without a wallet. **Section 4 (hands-on deploy)** requires wallet + ETH from Block 1. If you see "Wallet not connected," complete Wallet & Faucet first.

**Lab document:** [TOKEN_CONCEPTS_LAB.md](TOKEN_CONCEPTS_LAB.md)

**Optional (CLI):** If you prefer the command line:
- **Docker:** `docker-compose exec ethereum-trainer bash` then `cd /app/scripts/cli-labs/standalone` then `node 8-token-concepts.js`

**Lab document:** [PLAYGROUND_TUTORIAL.md](../scripts/cli-labs/standalone/PLAYGROUND_TUTORIAL.md)

---

### 25–45 min — Ransomware Investigation Setup & Lab → LO-C3

**Students — What to do (follow [RANSOMWARE_INVESTIGATION_LAB.md](RANSOMWARE_INVESTIGATION_LAB.md)):**

**You need TWO terminals.**

**Terminal 1 — Guided lab:**
- **Docker:** `docker-compose exec ethereum-trainer bash` then:
  ```bash
  cd /app/scripts/cli-labs/standalone
  node forensics-setup.js      # Generate scenario first (required!)
  node 6-ransomware-investigation.js
  ```
- **Local:**
  ```bash
  cd scripts/cli-labs/standalone
  node forensics-setup.js
  node 6-ransomware-investigation.js
  ```

**Terminal 2 — Investigation commands:**
- **Docker:** `docker-compose exec ethereum-trainer bash` then `npx hardhat console --network localhost`
- **Local:** `npx hardhat console --network localhost`

When the lab prompts you to run investigation commands, switch to Terminal 2, run the commands, then return to Terminal 1 to enter your findings. Use **Hardhat console** (not Playground) for investigation — it keeps the lab flow clear.

**Lab document:** [RANSOMWARE_INVESTIGATION_LAB.md](RANSOMWARE_INVESTIGATION_LAB.md)

---

### 45–60 min — Ransomware Lab Completion → LO-C3, LO-C6

**Students:** Finish the investigation, enter all findings, get your score.

**Pause:** *“What makes blockchain forensics possible? What are the limitations?”*

---

## Block 2 (60 min)

### 0–30 min — Smart Contract Guide (SimpleStorage) → LO-C4

**Students — What to do (follow [SMART_CONTRACT_GUIDE.md](SMART_CONTRACT_GUIDE.md)):**
1. Open `contracts/SimpleStorage.sol` — create or use the existing contract.
2. Compile: `npx hardhat compile`
3. Ensure the blockchain is running. Deploy:
   - `npm run deploy` (deploys PoS; SimpleStorage may need a separate script), or
   - `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-simple-storage.js --network localhost`
4. Interact: `node scripts/interact-simple-storage.js` or use Hardhat console.

**Lab document:** [SMART_CONTRACT_GUIDE.md](SMART_CONTRACT_GUIDE.md)

---

### 30–50 min — Contract Builder (Advanced Template) → LO-C5

**Students — Pick one:**

| Template | Lab Document | CLI Path |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Crowdfunding** | [CROWDFUNDING_LAB.md](CROWDFUNDING_LAB.md) | `node interactive.js` → 9 → 5 |
| **House Sale** | [HOUSE_SALE_LAB.md](HOUSE_SALE_LAB.md) | `node interactive.js` → 9 → 1 |
| **Vehicle Title** | [VEHICLE_TITLE_LAB.md](VEHICLE_TITLE_LAB.md) | `node interactive.js` → 9 → 2 |
| **Ransomware Advanced** | [RANSOMWARE_ADVANCED_LAB.md](RANSOMWARE_ADVANCED_LAB.md) | `node forensics-setup-advanced.js` then `node 7-ransomware-advanced.js` |

**Instructor:** For House Sale, assign Admin, Seller, Buyer. For Crowdfunding, assign Creator and Contributors. For Vehicle Title, assign Admin (DMV) and Owners. **Dashboard:** Select the matching contract type (Classroom Vote, Voting, Event Tickets, Crowdfunding, House Sale, Vehicle Title) when adding a contract.

---

### 50–60 min — Recap & Capstone Ideas → LO-C6

**Instructor:** Recap: forensics → ransomware → SimpleStorage → contract builder. Suggest:
- Trace a custom transaction flow and document it
- Modify SimpleStorage and redeploy
- Run the Advanced Ransomware lab and compare to basic

Point to `docs/` for all lab guides.

## Tips for All Scenarios

1. **Before class:** Run the lab once end-to-end. Note your IP and firewall rules.
2. **Pacing:** Wait for most students before moving on; use “thumbs up when ready.”
3. **Stuck students:** Use the instructor dashboard to fund wallets. If connection fails, direct students to the **Diagnostics** view (connection checks, RPC tests).
4. **Faucet backup:** If "Request 5 ETH" doesn't work, use CLI **Account Manager** (option 10 in `node interactive.js`) to create/fund accounts.
5. **Discussion:** Use the pause questions to reinforce concepts.
6. **Backup:** If RPC fails, students can use the Learn tab and read docs offline.
7. **Verify connection:** Run `node scripts/verify-connection.js` to test RPC and contract.
8. **Validator Simulation (local only):** Students running locally (not Docker) can try `npm run lab5` for validator mechanics — see [scripts/cli-labs/README.md](../scripts/cli-labs/README.md).
